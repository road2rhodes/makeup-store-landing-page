# makeup-store-landing-page

A landing page that allows me to play with what I learned so far about HTML and CSS (and maybe some Javascript).

I want to focus on the following with this design:
* Semantic HTML
* Flexbox (possibly Grid)
* Responsive Design (with variants for mobile, tablet, and desktop)
